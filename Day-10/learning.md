Day 10: Combining Variables, Loops, and Functions  

*What I Learned*  

*1. Using Variables, Loops, and Functions Together*  
- *Variables:* Store data for use within loops and functions.  
- *Loops:* Perform repetitive tasks efficiently.  
- *Functions:* Organize logic and make the code reusable.  

*2. Practical Examples*  
1. *Factorial Calculation:*  
   - Using a function and a loop to calculate the factorial of a number:  
    
2. *Prime Number Check:*  
   - A function to determine if a number is prime using a loop:  
 
3. *Fibonacci Series:*  
   - Generate the Fibonacci sequence using a function and a loop:  
     

*Reflection*  
- Combining variables, loops, and functions made solving problems simpler and more structured.  
- Debugging logic in examples like Fibonacci helped me understand the importance of clear steps.
