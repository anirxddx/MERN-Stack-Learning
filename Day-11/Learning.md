Day 11: Problem-Solving Practice  

*What I Learned*  

*1. Problem-Solving with Variables, Loops, and Functions*  
- Practiced applying variables, loops, and functions together to solve real-world problems.  
- Focused on writing clean and modular code to handle different scenarios.  

 *2. Problems Solved*  
1. *Sum of an Array*  
   - Calculated the total sum of numbers in a list using a loop.  

2. *Largest Number in a array*  
   - Found the maximum value in an array using a loop.   

3. *Factorial of a Number*  
   - Used a function with a loop to calculate the factorial of a number.  
   

*Reflection*  
- Practicing problems helped me strengthen my understanding of combining concepts.
