Day 4: Browser-Server Communication  

*What I Learned*  

*Browser-Server Communication Basics*  
- The browser (client) communicates with the server to request and receive data for displaying web pages.  
- The communication occurs through a *request-response cycle* using protocols like HTTP or HTTPS.  

*Request-Response Cycle*  
1. *Request:*  
   - The browser sends a request to the server, which includes:  
     - *HTTP Method:* Defines the action (e.g., GET, POST, PUT).  
     - *Headers:* Provide additional information (e.g., content type, authorization).  
     - *URL:* Specifies the resource location.  

2. *Response:*  
   - The server responds with:  
     - *Status Code:* Indicates the result of the request (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).  
     - *Headers:* Contain metadata (e.g., server type, cache-control).  
     - *Body:* Contains the requested data (e.g., HTML, JSON).  


*Reflection*  
- Learned how browser-server communication powers web applications.  
- Analyzing requests and responses using DevTools provided practical insights.  
- Exploring SSL certificates deepened my understanding of HTTPS security.
