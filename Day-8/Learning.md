Day 8: Loops (For and While)  

*1. Loops*  
- Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times.  

*2. Types of Loops*  
1. *For Loop:*  
   - Executes a block of code for a fixed number of iterations.  
   - Example (Python):  
     python
     for i in range(5):
         print(i)  # Output: 0 1 2 3 4
       

2. *While Loop:*  
   - Executes code as long as a condition is true.  
   - Example (JavaScript):  
     javascript
     let i = 0;
     while (i < 5) {
         console.log(i);
         i++;
     }


*Hands-On Practice*  
1. Print Numbers from 1 to 10:  
   ```python
   for i in range(1, 11):
       print(i)  # Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

	2.	Print Even Numbers Using a While Loop:

let i = 2;
while (i <= 10) {
    console.log(i);  // Output: 2 4 6 8 10
    i += 2;
}

Reflection
	•	Learned to use loops to simplify repetitive tasks.
	•	Writing examples clarified the difference between for and while loops.
