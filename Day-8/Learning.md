Day 8: Loops (For and While)  

*1. Loops*  
- Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times.  

*2. Types of Loops*  
1. *For Loop:*  
   - Executes a block of code for a fixed number of iterations.  
   
2. *While Loop:*  
   - Executes code as long as a condition is true.  
   - Example (JavaScript):  
     javascript
     let i = 0;
     while (i < 5) {
         console.log(i);
         i++;
     }

Reflection
	•	Learned to use loops to simplify repetitive tasks.
	•	Writing examples clarified the difference between for and while loops.
